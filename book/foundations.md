# Foundations

This document lays out the core concepts and foundation of the Gradle Cookbook project.

The project demonstrates a modular Gradle build composed of multiple subprojects. Each module showcases an aspect of building a real-world application with Gradle, from common utilities up through the final runnable application.

These foundations are the basis for the cookbook. The book chapters and accompanying notebooks build upon this structure.
